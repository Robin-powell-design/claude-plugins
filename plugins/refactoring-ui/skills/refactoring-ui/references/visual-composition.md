# Visual Composition Principles

Based on Molly Bang's *Picture This: How Pictures Work*. These principles govern how shapes, colors, positions, and spatial relationships create emotional responses. Apply to UI layout, illustration choices, hero sections, marketing pages, and any visual storytelling.

## Shape Psychology

### Pointed / Triangular shapes
- Feel **alert, aggressive, dangerous, exciting**
- Teeth, claws, thorns, mountain peaks — all pointed
- Diagonal edges create tension and energy
- Use for: attention-grabbing CTAs, warning indicators, dynamic compositions

### Rounded / Curved shapes
- Feel **safe, soft, comforting, huggable**
- Babies, clouds, bubbles — all round
- Reduce perceived threat or urgency
- Use for: friendly interfaces, onboarding, approachable branding

### Flat horizontal base
- Creates **stability, groundedness, calm**
- Things with flat bases don't topple — they feel reliable
- Use for: trust-building sections, stable navigation, grounded layouts

### Vertical shapes
- Feel **active, alert, upright, reliable**
- Standing figures, pillars, towers
- Use for: authority, professional presence

## Size and Dominance

### Bigger = more powerful / important
- Larger elements dominate the composition
- They feel more important, more in control
- Use for: primary headings, hero images, key CTAs

### Smaller = more vulnerable / less important
- Smaller elements feel subordinate
- Can evoke sympathy or feel delicate
- Use for: secondary information, supporting details

### Relative size creates emotional dynamics
- A small figure next to a large one = vulnerability, power imbalance
- Equal-sized elements = balance, equality, competition
- Slight size difference = subtle hierarchy without drama

## Color and Emotion

### Red
- Blood, fire, warmth, danger, vitality, passion
- Demands attention — use sparingly for maximum impact
- In UI: errors, destructive actions, urgency, important badges

### White (on dark backgrounds)
- Powerful, luminous, pure
- Maximum impact when used with restraint against darkness
- In UI: primary text on dark mode, highlighted elements

### Dark backgrounds
- Imply night, mystery, threat, drama, sophistication
- Create a different emotional tone than light backgrounds
- In UI: premium/luxury branding, dark mode, dramatic hero sections

### Pale / muted colors
- Feel less strong, less energetic
- Can feel delicate, refined, or washed out
- In UI: disabled states, background tints, subtle accents

### Same color = same team
- Elements sharing a color feel associated, related, grouped
- In UI: use consistent color to show related items belong together

## Position and Space

### Upper half of composition
- Feels: **free, triumphant, happy, spiritual, light**
- Objects placed high feel elevated, aspirational
- In UI: positive messaging, success states, brand promises

### Lower half of composition
- Feels: **threatened, heavy, sad, grounded, earthbound**
- Objects placed low feel weighed down, stable, or trapped
- In UI: grounding elements, footer content, contextual details

### Objects higher up have more pictorial weight
- Even if same size, a higher element feels more emphasized
- In UI: place most important content above the fold

### Center = strongest focal point
- The center of any frame is the most effective point of attention
- Elements here feel balanced and stable
- In UI: centered hero content, modal dialogs, key CTAs

### Edges and corners create tension
- Placing elements near edges creates discomfort, unease, drama
- Elements feel pushed against boundaries, constrained
- In UI: avoid accidentally trapping key elements near edges; use edge tension deliberately for dramatic effect

---

## Line and Movement

### Diagonal lines
- Create **movement, tension, energy, dynamism**
- The more diagonal, the more unstable/exciting
- In UI: dynamic layouts, progress indicators, active states

### Horizontal lines
- Create **calm, stability, rest, landscape**
- Feel peaceful and grounded
- In UI: dividers, navigation bars, stable layouts

### Vertical lines
- Create **formality, height, reliability, alertness**
- Feel structured and upright
- In UI: sidebars, columns, structured grids

---

## The Frame

### The frame creates a separate world
- Everything inside has its own forces, scale, and logic
- Objects relate to the frame's edges, not to external reality
- In UI: card boundaries, modal windows, section containers all create "worlds"

### Frame edges generate force
- Elements near frame edges feel pulled toward them
- Creates tension, drama, or a sense of breaking free
- In UI: full-bleed images feel expansive; contained images feel controlled

### Distance from viewer
- Closer elements (larger, overlapping foreground) create emotional connection
- Distant elements feel detached, less personally relevant
- In UI: key features should feel "close" (large, prominent); background context stays small

---

## Combined Principles

These principles never work in isolation — they always interact:

- A **small, round, pale shape in the lower half** = maximum vulnerability
- A **large, pointed, dark shape in the upper half** = maximum threat/dominance
- A **centered, medium, warm-colored shape** = balanced, inviting focus

### For UI Application:
1. **Hero sections**: Use size, position, and color together to create the right emotional response
2. **Illustrations**: Choose shapes and positions that match the message (playful = round + bright; urgent = pointed + red)
3. **Layout composition**: Place the most important element where it has the most visual weight (center or upper portion, larger size)
4. **Empty states**: Use position and size to make illustrations feel friendly and encouraging, not lost and lonely
5. **Dark mode**: Remember that dark backgrounds shift the entire emotional register — everything feels more dramatic and premium
